<h1>Trip To Japan Day - 1 Oct 11, 2012</h1>
<p>Like many people, traveling to Japan is part of my list bucket, something that I want to do least once in my life.</p>
<p>On year 2012, two of my friends and I  decided to finally cross that off our list bucket by planning a two weeks to Japan.</p>
<p>Our journey sets off on Oct 11, 2012 with  <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong>, from Seattle to Japan.</p>
<p>Our flight was early in the morning around 5-6 AM, the total flight hours were 11. Since we all came from work, so we were all pretty tired already during that time, 9-11 hours flight was not fun if you are not able to sleep. For those who usually can not sleep during the flight, I recommend you to bring a book or an e-book to read, to keep yourself busy till the end of the flight.</p>
<p>I was already afternoon when we arrived <strong>Haneda Airport</strong>. Since we have booked our hostel at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gD7rsXhHbrS2">Asakusa</a>, we have to take rail ride from the airport to the hostel.</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>Due to this is our fire time been in Japan, so we got lost easily. It took us 2 hours to find that hostel, one thing we learned quickly is that Japanese people are shy to use English to respond us, which is understandable. Since English is their second language, even though the school teaches it, but it still be difficult for them to understand what we were trying to ask them. Heck, I have been living in the United States for over 20 years, I can&#39;t speak English fluently.</p>
<p>So, yes, this is all we did on our first day of the journey. The long flight was brutal and getting lost in the foreign country was no fun either. Good thing is that we learned where all the stores are during that two hours! Therefore, that 2 hours was not a total lost after all.</p>
