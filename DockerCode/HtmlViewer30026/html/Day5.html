<h1>Trip To Japan Day - 5 Oct 15, 2012</h1>
<p>I can not really say that I am exciting about this day or afraid, since I never really rode a bicycle in my life and my friend has signed us up for a <strong>Cycling Tour</strong> in Tokyo! (SCREAM!)</p>

<p>Our tour was scheduled at 9:00 AM, we got there early, I was telling my friends that I have absolutely no experience on riding a bicycle before, so what we were about to do is going to be very challenging to me. Since it was still early when we got to the tour office, so we decided to have breakfast just right outside of the street.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It looks yummy doesn&#39;t it!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so after finishing our yummy breakfast, it is time to face my <strong>FEAR</strong>! I told one of our tour guide that I do not know how to ride a bike, so one of them decided to stay behind with me and make sure I don&#39;t get left behind. You must be thinking, wow that must be very embarrassing and you are right! It is SUPER embarrassing, but I did not let that ruin the tour fun, no can&#39;t do~</p>
<p>I started out riding the bike just outside of the office, to get used to it. One thing that I did not expected was that the bike is sooooo tall! I literally have to hop a little in order to get on the seat. And finally the tour started, I would not say that it has a good start, there was a car on the street and the passenger opened their door and it almost hit me. The tour guide screamed when she saw the whole thing. After that was me hitting the wall after crossing the street (I guess I am still not used to stopping the bike). But! The most difficult thing for me to do is riding the bike up to the hill! After many attempts, I finally gave up and just walked up the hill..(Walk of shame!). Most of the hills were from crossing the bridges.</p>

<ul>
<li>Me and the tour guide was the first one got here because we took a shortcut! HA~</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <strong>Tsukuda-Jima</strong> was our first stop. Due to I did not know how to ride a bike, so the tour guide guided me to our first stop with a shortcut. That&#39;s why we got there way early before the rest of the tour group.</p>
<p>Afterward, we headed to <strong>Tsukiji Fish Market</strong>, it&#39;s like a regular fish market that you see, except if you like sashimi, then you are in luck! You can get fresh fish here and they are very good for making sashimi. We took a short break here, looking around the market, this fish market is actually quite huge, it is easy to get lost here if you are not careful.</p>
<p>As you know it, after that short 10-20 minutes break, we got back on to our bikes again and crossing few more bridges till we got to <strong>Odaiba</strong>. Yes, as few of you might realized that we been to this place before! On our <strong>Day 3</strong> journey when we went to see the <strong>Gundam Statue</strong>, we have been to <strong>Odaiba</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, we have our lunch, kind tour guide got us some fresh fish slices from the fish market, this is why I am telling now, the fish that they got for us was really good and fresh!</p>
<p>After our delicious lunch meal, we head off to <strong>Zojoji Temple and Tokyo Tower</strong>. Although, after seeing Tokyo SkyTree, Tokyo Tower does not see all that impressive, but I always wanted to see it when I was kid, so it&#39;s all good! Then it came down to our last stop, the <strong>Imperial Palace</strong>. You must be thinking &quot;OH MY GOD, is it a big caslte!?&quot; Well, castle yes, big? NO. Well, actually I don&#39;t know, since we could not go inside and see it, so it&#39;s hard to tell from the outside...</p>
<p>Important thing though! It&#39;s that I finally learned how to ride the bike well! I learned how to dodge the people on the street, which is something quite difficult to do, since on the rush hour, there are tons of people on the street. If you know the Japanese culture well, most people walk to work, so there are always many people on the street. This tour started out as a nightmare, but in the end I was able to manage to master the riding skill, which I am very proud of myself, and so were the other people from the group, HA~</p>
