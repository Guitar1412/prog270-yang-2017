Uwajimaya, a good Japanese supermarket. Even though everything is a bit overpriced in the store, but they are in good quality. Looking for a foreign book that you can not find online or regular bookstore, then you might want to try your luck in the Uwajimaya, the place is like a gold mine, you might be able to find something very valuable in the store.

If you like to watch baseball game live, then I highly recommend you to drive down to Uwajimaya and park your car on the street near the store. Grab a cream puff when you are there as well cause they are just too yummy. The street parking is cheaper than the garage parking and also you want to avoid the crowd after the game is over. You will not be stuck in the traffic if you have park the park near the Uwajimaya. I have done so myself many time, that is why I recommend any baseball fans or tourist out there to do.

Or lets say that you are more of a bus person, you do not own a car or you do not feel like driving to the stadium area during the game day, then you can take a bus ride to the 'King Street Station' nearby, if you arrive earlier and got sometime to spare, then you can head to Uwajimaya to look around and see if you can find any valuable treasures in there and then head to the stadium afterward.
