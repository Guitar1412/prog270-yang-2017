### Gundam Statue - Odaiba
If you are a Gundam fan like my friend, then you TOTALLY need to come to **Odaiba** to see this Gundam Statue! Far as I know they have replace a new Gundam Statue over there now. It is not an illuminated life-size [Unicorn Gundam Statue](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/09/24/national/gundams-20-meter-replacement-statue-unveiled-odaiba/#.Wf_a5mhSyUk). Go see it now!

### Tokyo Ramen Kokugikan Mai

This is one of the biggest [ramen festival](http://www.aquacity.jp.e.yp.hp.transer.com/tokyo_ramen_kokugikan/)! There are so many different ramen choice here!  

The festival was there when we were in Japan, which was during October, I am not 100% sure if this event is seasonal, but if you planning on going to Odaiba during October, then definitely go there to have a bawl of a delicious ramen!

- It is really yummy! In my honest opinion, their ramen are not as salty as the one you can find in the United States.

### Miraikan

[Miraikan](http://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/) is a science / innovation museum. The display all the current invented technology and also future technology, like robots and medicines.

This is a great place for kids to learn about robot science and science evolution.

### Oedo Onsen Monogatari

[Oedo Onsen Monogatari](http://daiba.ooedoonsen.jp/en/#onsen) is a high end onsen theme park. They have in door and out door onsen. Each in door onsen has different temperature.

- Cold
- Hot
- Warm

For the out door, they have regular onsen and **foot bath**! They also provide a pebbles walk passage, for those who likes foot massages as they walk pass through the theme park. There is a in door festive mall and restaurant, as you enjoy your dinner meal, you can watch their live talk show and festive dance in their

EdoTown.
