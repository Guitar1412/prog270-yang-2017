# Trip To Japan Day - 2 Oct 12, 2012

Day 2, thank to us getting lost yesterday, we saw a Danny's right outside of our hostel. Since Danny's serves western food, three of us

decided to go there and have our first breakfast in Japan. Now you might ask why are we eating western food in Japan,

as you might remember that I said during Day 1 journey, many local citizens are very shy to respond us in English. Therefore,

going to a western type of restaurant might be easier for us to order some food and ask some information.


## Day 2 Schedule

| Morning | Noon / Afternoon | Night |
| :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |
| Sensō-ji       | SkyTree Tower    | Free time       |
| Kaminarimon Gate | Gundam Cafe |
|   | Akihabara  |

After the breakfast, we were following our scheduled plan. First we go visit the Sensō-ji, and then the Kaminarimon Gate.

I am not all that familiar with the Sensō-ji, but I did heard a lot about the Kaminarimon Gate. Kaminarimon Gate is quite fammous.

I have seen it on the TV and people are always talking about it.

### Sensō-ji

Now, I am not saying that **Sensō-ji** is not famous, it's just personally I rather heard the name of the temple from tourists that have

been to Japan-Asakusa many times. Although I did saw tons of tourist when I was standing outside of the temple.

### Kaminarimon Gate

**Kaminarimon Gate** Most of the tour TV show introduce this spot, usually this place is crowded, you would want to come either during night time to avoid the crowd. Local citizen/students like to come here for selfies as well. There are many shops and store on the side street as you walk pass the gate.

### SkyTree Tower

The tower is very tall, but like Space Needle, it cost money to go to the top. That's why we only took pictures from the outside.

Sorry that I can not tell you what is inside the tower, but I am sure it is worth it to check it out if you want to see it.

For more information feel free to check out this website [Tokyo SkyTree Tower](http://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/ticket/).

### Gundam Cafe

This is one of the spot that my friend has picked, he really likes Gundam, and since we do not feel like going to 'Maid Cafe', so

we chose 'Gundam Cafe' to have our lunch. As you can see the photos below in the photo section, their menu is very fancy, their food

design is all related to Gundam! They also have TV screen playing Gundam music and have Gundam models around on the wall to display.

### Akihabara

If you are a nerd then you will know this place, why? WELL, if you like the followings, then this is right place for you!
- animes
- games
- mangas
- cosplay

We did not spent much time here because we are mainly here for 'Gundam Cafe.' Many of the art show does not allow photographing, so

I do not have any photos to show for.
