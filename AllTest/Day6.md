# Trip To Japan Day - 6 Oct 16, 2012

Sorry, not much happening on Day 6, we decided to have one free day to do whatever we want. In the morning I chose to wash my clothes and my friends went to the zoo.

## Day 6 Schedule

| Morning | Afternoon | Night |
| :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |
| Free time      | Free time    | Free time       |

The laundry did not took long to finish, plus the sunny day made it faster. I spent rest of my dad sitting in the living room watching Japanese TV shows, funny thing is I do not speak Japanese, but it was funny to guess what people were saying. Also, I was not alone, there are others who were watching the TV with me. We have some good chat, to discuss where have everyone went when they were in Tokyo or Kyoto. Everyone started to get to know each other in the end, and we all went out to get food and brought back to the hostel and have a dinner party together. Beers and hot pots!

Originally, one of my friend was planning to go down to **Roppongi** for night club, but people were saying that city is quite dangerous to went alone, and drunk people were everywhere! That's when my friend decided not to go down there, which is wise choice!

Even though nothing really happened on Day 6, but Day 7 was going to be our last day in Tokyo and we planned to go to **Disney Sea**.

# Something to look forward to!
